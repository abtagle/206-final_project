This is the main learning too of this application.

Review allows you to learn words from your current level, or the words you have failed in New Quiz mode. 

The review screen allows you to:
 -navigate the list (Next Word ">>" and previous word "<<")
 -hear the current word ("Listen to Word" button)
 -view the word("Show Text")

You can view the whole list you are reviewing, and shuffle it so you can practise words.

If you are reviewing your failed words, you can remove the word from the list with the "Remove Word" button when you think you know it well enough.  Otherwise, it will be removed when you spell it correctly in a quiz.
